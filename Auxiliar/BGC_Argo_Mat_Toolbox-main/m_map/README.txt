The m_map package is provided as a convenience for users
of the GO-BGC tutorial package.
The default mapping used by plot_trajectories.m uses
Matlab-native mapping functions that were introduced
in version R2018b. Older versions of Matlab will use
the m_map package instead.
This is version 1.4m, downloaded in June 2021 from
https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html
